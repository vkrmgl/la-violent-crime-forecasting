# LA Violent Crime Forecasting

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict violent crime in Los Angeles at the ZCTA (ZIP Code Tabulation Area) level.
The goal is to model relationships between past crime patterns, socioeconomic indicators, and temporal cycles to understand and forecast future crime risk.

This project is part of our work in the UC Berkeley Master of Information & Data Science (MIDS) program
